As far as I can tell. every Rust statement is an expression equivalent to the expression () (ignoring side effects and non-termination) which Rust classifies as the empty tuple. AFAIK in the ML family of languages, the corresponding value is the only element of unit type, which id denoted by ().  Try adding () as the return type for any main method. [Rust evidently recognizes () as the name of the empty tuple type.] AFAIK, the Rust compiler (as shown in the Rust playground) will accept it.  So the body of a Rust function is simply a curly-brace block expression even when a function has no return type.  In Rust, a function with no return type implicitly has return type ().\n",

      "The phrase \"has a unique string representation\" has many possible meanings.  \"Unique\" with respect to what?  According to what level of granularity are values distinguished?  The two common answers are (i) structural equality and (ii) identity of representation.  In principle, the correct level of granularity for a given programming language is observational equivalence in that language, but this definition may make finer grain distinctions that are necessary or appropriate in the context of writing most code.  For example, all distinct Strings in Java (as created by the new operation) are observationally distinct (since Java defines == as object identity), but different copies of the \"same\" string are not distinguished in most Java computations because the equals method returns true when given different copies of the \"same\" string.  I suspect that Rectangle as formulated as a struct in this chapter behaves similarly.  Are two distinct Rectangles r1, r2 with the same dimensions observationally equivalent?  I  don't know about Rust, but I doubt it.  in Java, C, and C++, r1 == r2 is false because they do not have same address in memory.  Their representations are not shared. If the variables are mutable, changing one value does not change the other.   \n",
